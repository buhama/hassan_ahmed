          As someone who was very involved in student organizations during my
          studies at uOttawa, I had an interesting perspective on how the
          pandemic affected hosting events. As soon as the country shut down,
          people had already started looking into ways to reimagine their
          canceled events into an online format. I was involved in two major
          events at the time, that were abruptly canceled after the pandemic.
          One being the Student Life Awards hosted by CVUO and the other STEAM
          Fest hosted by uOttawa STEAM. For STEAM fest the team looked into a
          few options on how they could host their event online, after all the
          event is a series of workshops, but eventually opted for canceling the
          event due to the lack of interest in an online event – which ended up
          being one of the biggest hurdles for everyone going forward.{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For the Student Life Awards, an awards show for all student clubs on
          campus, canceling was not really an option. There were still people
          interested in knowing the results, but what transpired was hardly an
          event and just a 40-minute-long video with different presenters simply
          announcing the winners. While this was a nice experience for the team
          that had worked so hard on the event, it still wasn’t really an event.{' '}
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For a few months after most events ended up being different versions
          of a Zoom call and sometimes just a Zoom call. And how well they did
          was entirely dependant on the content of those calls. If you had good
          speakers’ people would come and if not, then probably not. That and
          some preliminary marketing ended up being really all online events
          ended up becoming.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It wasn’t until the year after, where we started to see some real
          innovation. People started using platforms like Gather.Town, hosting
          game shows and other interactive ideas to make things more
          interesting.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For me, I noticed that the one thing that resulted in the success of
          an online event was if it was able to deliver its base value to its
          attendees still. Sort of like the minimum viable product of the event.
          So, for example, speaker and academic events could still do well,
          because the minimum value was listening to the speakers that could
          easily be transferred over to an online environment. We hosted online
          Clubs Fairs, which were pretty much impossible to replicate online
          since the base value was catching students as they walked by your
          table or for students to hit up a table on their way to class. Things
          that weren’t easily made possible online.
        </p>

        <h2>Award Shows</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          We tried to take inspiration from large award shows that happened
          during the pandemic. The first one on our radar that happened after
          the pandemic was the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. I personally
          wasn’t a huge fan of how they went about it. Those winning already
          knew they had won and were sent their trophies ahead of time. The
          winners sent back recorded videos to be featured on the live show,
          which was hosted by Victoria Justice. This ended up being kind of
          boring to watch and everything felt shallow and scripted. The
          excitement of seeing your favourite celebrities win an award and freak
          out about it wasn’t there.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The next award show that caught our attention was the Emmys. A person
          would be stationed outside of the houses of all the nominees and when
          the winner was announced during the live show, the person would either
          present the award or just leave.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This ended up being a much nicer watch and kind of outlined the base
          value of award shows. The suspense and excitement of watching your
          favorites win the award live, getting their reactions and their
          off-the-cuff acceptance speeches as they do their best to hold back
          their excitement.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>The Student Life Awards 2021 (SLA2021)</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our awards show was scheduled to be hosted on March 14th, 2021, as a
          sort of memoir to SLA2020 which was scheduled to happen on March 14th,
          2020 and would mark the 1 year anniversary of the school shutting down
          due to the pandemic. We start planning the event the summer before,
          however. At the start of our planning, we were hopeful that we would
          be able to host the event in person by the time March came around, but
          a few months in, and the pandemic not going anywhere, we eventually
          lost hope and started thinking of online options.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Bringing the awards to the nominees and winners was definitely
          something we wanted to do but didn’t have the resources the Emmys’ had
          to station someone at every nominee’s house. One thing from the early
          pandemic that also inspired our final idea was the graduation
          ceremonies that some teachers did for their graduating class, where
          they had a sort of car parade in the town, and drove past the houses
          of graduating students. We joked about renting a bus and driving the
          ceremonies to everyone’s houses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Combining that with what the Emmys’ did was how we came up with our
          final product. We would host the ceremonies online, but during the
          show, we would also send out a handful of cars in the city and
          hand-deliver the trophies to the winners as they won. This way we were
          able to save on resources since one person could hit 5 or 6 houses,
          instead of the Emmy’s one person per house, and no one was stationed
          outside anyone’s house for nothing.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This covered our base value of getting the reactions of everyone
          winning their awards live, they got to give their acceptance speeches
          while holding their trophies and many nominees also had everyone
          gather at one place and we were able to replicate the feeling of
          winning an award surrounded by friends.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The whole thing also added an unplanned feature being the constant
          vlogging of all the delivery people as they drove around the city on
          strict timelines delivering trophies. This provided a lot of candid
          entertainment to fill in between people winning awards, somewhat
          similar to talking to your table during an actual award show.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Finally, using OBS, Zoom, Hopin, and some creative thinking we were
          also able to present the online ceremony in a professional manner that
          was levels above a typical Zoom call.

        <p>
          The logistics of the whole thing were insane, and I plan to write
          another article about that, but the main idea here is after we broke
          down the event to the minimum of what people wanted from award shows
          and then built on top of that we were able to find our golden idea.
          The event ended up being a huge success. The concept itself was
          entertaining to the viewers - and many of the attendees decided to
          join the team afterward.
