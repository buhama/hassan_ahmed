This means that users can expect to find the information they need more quickly and easily, and can even have the tool complete tasks for them automatically. This can be especially valuable for individuals who are pressed for time and need to be able to quickly and easily access the information they need in order to make important decisions, such as startup founders who are constantly balancing multiple tasks and responsibilities.

With its superior speed, accuracy, and personalization, ChatGPT could become the default choice for users looking to find information and complete tasks quickly and easily. This would be especially beneficial for startups, who often have to process large amounts of data and make quick decisions in order to stay competitive and grow their business.
