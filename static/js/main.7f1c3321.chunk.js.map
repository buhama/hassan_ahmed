perspective on how the\r\n          pandemic affected hosting events. As soon as the country shut down,\r\n          people had already started looking into ways to reimagine their\r\n          canceled events into an online format. I was involved in two major\r\n          events at the time, that were abruptly canceled after the pandemic.\r\n          One being the Student Life Awards hosted by CVUO and the other STEAM\r\n          Fest hosted by uOttawa STEAM. For STEAM fest the team looked into a\r\n          few options on how they could host their event online, after all the\r\n          event is a series of workshops, but eventually opted for canceling the\r\n          event due to the lack of interest in an online event – which ended up\r\n          being one of the biggest hurdles for everyone going forward.{' '}\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          For the Student Life Awards, an awards show for all student clubs on\r\n          campus, canceling was not really an option. There were still people\r\n          interested in knowing the results, but what transpired was hardly an\r\n          event and just a 40-minute-long video with different presenters simply\r\n          announcing the winners. While this was a nice experience for the team\r\n          that had worked so hard on the event, it still wasn’t really an event.{' '}\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          For a few months after most events ended up being different versions\r\n          of a Zoom call and sometimes just a Zoom call. And how well they did\r\n          was entirely dependant on the content of those calls. If you had good\r\n          speakers’ people would come and if not, then probably not. That and\r\n          some preliminary marketing ended up being really all online events\r\n          ended up becoming.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          It wasn’t until the year after, where we started to see some real\r\n          innovation. People started using platforms like Gather.Town, hosting\r\n          game shows and other interactive ideas to make things more\r\n          interesting.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          For me, I noticed that the one thing that resulted in the success of\r\n          an online event was if it was able to deliver its base value to its\r\n          attendees still. Sort of like the minimum viable product of the event.\r\n          So, for example, speaker and academic events could still do well,\r\n          because the minimum value was listening to the speakers that could\r\n          easily be transferred over to an online environment. We hosted online\r\n          Clubs Fairs, which were pretty much impossible to replicate online\r\n          since the base value was catching students as they walked by your\r\n          table or for students to hit up a table on their way to class. Things\r\n          that weren’t easily made possible online.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Award Shows</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          We tried to take inspiration from large award shows that happened\r\n          during the pandemic. The first one on our radar that happened after\r\n          the pandemic was the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. I personally\r\n          wasn’t a huge fan of how they went about it. Those winning already\r\n          knew they had won and were sent their trophies ahead of time. The\r\n          winners sent back recorded videos to be featured on the live show,\r\n          which was hosted by Victoria Justice. This ended up being kind of\r\n          boring to watch and everything felt shallow and scripted. The\r\n          excitement of seeing your favourite celebrities win an award and freak\r\n          out about it wasn’t there.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The next award show that caught our attention was the Emmys. A person\r\n          would be stationed outside of the houses of all the nominees and when\r\n          the winner was announced during the live show, the person would either\r\n          present the award or just leave.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          This ended up being a much nicer watch and kind of outlined the base\r\n          value of award shows. The suspense and excitement of watching your\r\n          favorites win the award live, getting their reactions and their\r\n          off-the-cuff acceptance speeches as they do their best to hold back\r\n          their excitement.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>The Student Life Awards 2021 (SLA2021)</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Our awards show was scheduled to be hosted on March 14th, 2021, as a\r\n          sort of memoir to SLA2020 which was scheduled to happen on March 14th,\r\n          2020 and would mark the 1 year anniversary of the school shutting down\r\n          due to the pandemic. We start planning the event the summer before,\r\n          however. At the start of our planning, we were hopeful that we would\r\n          be able to host the event in person by the time March came around, but\r\n          a few months in, and the pandemic not going anywhere, we eventually\r\n          lost hope and started thinking of online options.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Bringing the awards to the nominees and winners was definitely\r\n          something we wanted to do but didn’t have the resources the Emmys’ had\r\n          to station someone at every nominee’s house. One thing from the early\r\n          pandemic that also inspired our final idea was the graduation\r\n          ceremonies that some teachers did for their graduating class, where\r\n          they had a sort of car parade in the town, and drove past the houses\r\n          of graduating students. We joked about renting a bus and driving the\r\n          ceremonies to everyone’s houses.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Combining that with what the Emmys’ did was how we came up with our\r\n          final product. We would host the ceremonies online, but during the\r\n          show, we would also send out a handful of cars in the city and\r\n          hand-deliver the trophies to the winners as they won. This way we were\r\n          able to save on resources since one person could hit 5 or 6 houses,\r\n          instead of the Emmy’s one person per house, and no one was stationed\r\n          outside anyone’s house for nothing.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          This covered our base value of getting the reactions of everyone\r\n          winning their awards live, they got to give their acceptance speeches\r\n          while holding their trophies and many nominees also had everyone\r\n          gather at one place and we were able to replicate the feeling of\r\n          winning an award surrounded by friends.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The whole thing also added an unplanned feature being the constant\r\n          vlogging of all the delivery people as they drove around the city on\r\n          strict timelines delivering trophies. This provided a lot of candid\r\n          entertainment to fill in between people winning awards, somewhat\r\n          similar to talking to your table during an actual award show.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Finally, using OBS, Zoom, Hopin, and some creative thinking we were\r\n          also able to present the online ceremony in a professional manner that\r\n          was levels above a typical Zoom call.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Finally, using OBS, Zoom, Hopin, and some creative thinking we were\r\n          also able to present the online ceremony in a professional manner that\r\n          was levels above a typical Zoom call.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The logistics of the whole thing were insane, and I plan to write\r\n          another article about that, but the main idea here is after we broke\r\n          down the event to the minimum of what people wanted from award shows\r\n          and then built on top of that we were able to find our golden idea.\r\n          The event ended up being a huge success. The concept itself was\r\n          entertaining to the viewers - and many of the attendees decided to\r\n          join the team afterward.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default How_The_Pandemic_Forced_Event_Innovation;\r\n","import { Button, Link, useColorModeValue } from '@chakra-ui/react';\r\nimport { ArrowBackIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons';\r\nimport { Link as RouterLink } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nconst CVUO_Clubs_Portal = () => {\r\n  const buttonColor = useColorModeValue('purple', 'green');\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className='blog'>\r\n      <Link as={RouterLink} to='/' style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}>\r\n        <Button\r\n          leftIcon={<ArrowBackIcon />}\r\n          colorScheme={buttonColor}\r\n          variant='solid'\r\n        >\r\n          Go Back Home\r\n        </Button>\r\n      </Link>\r\n      <div className='blog-title'>\r\n        <h1>CyberMonkE - IBM Design Challenge</h1>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className='blog-body'>\r\n        {/* TODO: Add Blog Images */}{' '}\r\n        <p>\r\n          CVUO has been managing clubs for two years and has been conducting all\r\n          internal logistics manually. When clubs submitted applications, those\r\n          applications were manually added to a Google Sheet, the clubs were\r\n          manually added to the CVUO Website as a “Blog” post, every update was\r\n          requested through email and then done manually, and so and so forth.\r\n          When taking on the challenge of managing the club system at uOttawa,\r\n          the internal logistics were not a consideration, and every logistical\r\n          problem was dealt with as it came forward, and many times with a lot\r\n          of additional work hours.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          A better system would automate repetitive tasks, gives clubs control\r\n          of their public profiles, create an easy to access database for the\r\n          CVUO executives and be cost-efficient.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          While searching for a solution we were approached by external\r\n          contractors that seemed to offer what we were looking for, an\r\n          all-in-one solution that would cost a fortune, but would save us 100s\r\n          of hours yearly. After starting a trial with one of the more promising\r\n          contractors, it was shown that while external companies could solve\r\n          some problems, they came with their own issues and weren’t the perfect\r\n          solution we were looking for and were far too costly.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          So, what do you do at that point?

For one the\r\n          learning curve was too high, which was a problem as CVUO executives\r\n          almost entirely cycle out every 3-4 years, due to it being a\r\n          student-run organization. A lot of time was spent on creating a\r\n          Microsoft Access database, but it didn’t end up being, what we needed.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          While working with Microsoft Access, we also looked into having a\r\n          back-end portal to the CVUO website. The initial goal of that was\r\n          solely to have a place for clubs to see the most up-to-date\r\n          information and links regarding various club-related information. But\r\n          it later transformed into a lot more than that.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          MemberStack was recommended by the executives of the Mechanical\r\n          Engineering Student Society, who had been using it to have a backend\r\n          login for Mechanical Engineering students to have access to past\r\n          exams.

A system using MemberStack, Google Sheets, Squarespace Forms,\r\n          Sheet2site, Zapier & JotForm, all in tandem with each other ended up\r\n          being our near-perfect solution, which I hope will save all future\r\n          CVUO executives countless hours and let clubs update their information\r\n          themselves.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Quick Descriptions on Key Tools and Services</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <Link href='https://www.memberstack.com/' isExternal color='blue.500'>\r\n          <h3>MemberStack</h3>\r\n        </Link>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          MemberStack is a no-code solution for developers to create member\r\n          logins for their websites.

It contains all the information on a club from their logo,\r\n          constitution, social links to their club funding details. The same\r\n          Google Sheet also collects Club and Association Registration\r\n          Applications in both English and French. All the registration is\r\n          conducted through Jotform, through 4 different forms, two for Club\r\n          Registration in both English and French and then also two for\r\n          Association Registration in both English and French. Every submission\r\n          to those 4 forms is linked to a unique tab on the Master Sheet file,\r\n          labeled “All Applications” and sorted by submission date. This allows\r\n          the CVUO executives to review each application in one place and in the\r\n          order that they come through. While there are small differences\r\n          between the Association and Club registration forms, they are largely\r\n          the same, and placing all applications in one place is practical for\r\n          review.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Once the applications are reviewed by a CVUO executive and approved,\r\n          they are added manually as a member on the CVUO MemberStack. As soon\r\n          as a new member is added it is linked back to the same Google Sheets,\r\n          to a new tab for all approved clubs. This tab has extra columns\r\n          regarding club information that are not provided through the initial\r\n          application, namely the Club Funding information. This information is\r\n          later updated on each club’s profile through MemberStack manually.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>The ability for clubs to update their information themselves. </h3>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          With MemberStack and Squarespace a back end on the CVUO website was\r\n          easily made, it is the primary service that MemberStack offers. From\r\n          there a series of Squarespace Forms were made, where clubs could\r\n          submit new information about their club. Instead of using the\r\n          Squarespace forms as is, their HTML was copied and modified, where\r\n          each of the questions linked to the MemberStack API. The HTML was then\r\n          pasted to a page on the website part of the Clubs Portal. When clubs\r\n          fill out the forms it automatically updates their MemberStack profile.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          This however didn’t update the Master Sheet with all the clubs’\r\n          information, because while a new item was added on the Google Sheet\r\n          when a new MemberStack profile was created, it was not in any way\r\n          linked to MemberStack beyond that. However, this was solved via a\r\n          Zapier integration. The Zapier integration is triggered when a\r\n          MemberStack profile is updated, it would then find that record on the\r\n          Google Sheet by matching the Club IDs from the MemberStack profile\r\n          that is being updated and also updates the entire row with the new\r\n          MemberStack profile information.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          This allowed the Master Sheet to be constantly updated and allowed\r\n          clubs to be able to update their information on their own.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>\r\n          The ability for club updates to reflect on the Official Clubs List.\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          A simple solution to having the Official Clubs List be up to date and\r\n          to reflect the club database, aka the Master Sheet, would be to link\r\n          that same Master Sheet to the public website.

Two sheets were made, one for French and\r\n          one for English. This time, however, there was no need for a Master\r\n          Sheet as the events didn’t contain the personal information of any\r\n          students. The English sheet is connected to a Jotform, where clubs can\r\n          submit their event information. One preliminary step is to verify that\r\n          only registered clubs can get their events featured, as the Jotform\r\n          can be passed around easily. This is done by asking for clubs to\r\n          submit the club ID in the Jotform. The magic however happens back on\r\n          the Google Sheet, where all the applications, regardless of correct ID\r\n          or not are added to one tab on the sheet and then only added to a\r\n          second tab if the correct ID is added to the application.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          This is done by having a third tab on that same Google Sheet, that\r\n          uses the same connection capabilities from before on Google Sheets to\r\n          import the Club IDs from the Master Sheet to this third tab. The\r\n          aforementioned second tab adds all the events from the applications\r\n          only if the Club ID from the submissions matches any of the IDs from\r\n          the Master Sheet. The Club Name is also added by their Club ID. There\r\n          is one extra filter in this connection, which is the date, so events\r\n          with dates in the past are filtered out as well. The events are also\r\n          sorted by their date, so they show up in the correct order.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The French sheet simply connects to the English Sheet, but only with\r\n          the events that pass the preliminary ID and date check and only\r\n          publishes the French part of the submission.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>\r\n          A constantly updated Excel Online sheet shared with Conventions and\r\n          Reservations for VEMS logins\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          One major aspect of the system that always needed to be considered was\r\n          that the Conventions and Reservations department at the University of\r\n          Ottawa would always need an up-to-date file with all the club signing\r\n          officer information.

The file is updated via\r\n          Zapier. Every time a new profile is created on MemberStack, it adds a\r\n          new row on the Excel file and every time MemberStack is updated it\r\n          finds the row with the same ID as the updated MemberStack profile and\r\n          rewrites the row.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The final step for the Conventions and Reservations documents is that\r\n          there is also a Zapier connection that connects the Squarespace form\r\n          that clubs change their signing officers on to a tab on that Excel\r\n          Online file, which essentially logs every signing officer change.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>Future Improvements</h3>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          During the semesterly clubs’ review, many clubs end up discounting and\r\n          must be deleted from all our files.

It was a\r\n          3-day event where competitors from all over the world created 3D\r\n          design solutions to complex problems. After seeing large hackathons\r\n          year after year, it was an awesome initiative for engineers to compete\r\n          in something that wasn’t programming. And especially great for\r\n          aspiring Mechanical Engineers as Computer-Aided 3D Design is a major\r\n          component of our profession.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The event also featured workshops, presentations, and a list of social\r\n          community activities. After two sleepless nights, competitors\r\n          presented their solutions on the third day and the top 3 teams were\r\n          picked for each category. My team, <b>CyberMonkE</b>, placed{' '}\r\n          <b>2nd</b> for the <b>IBM Design Challenge</b>.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Design Criteria</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The IBM Design Challenge was to design an exoskeleton for a human arm,\r\n          that met the following specifications:\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>Lightweight </li>\r\n          <li>Enhanced strength to superhuman levels</li>\r\n          <li>Easy to clean</li>\r\n          <li>Fits all arm sizes</li>\r\n          <li>Accessible to users with physical disabilities</li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Solution</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Our solution used <b>Nylon Fibers</b> twisted in coils. When heated,\r\n          the coils retracted, behaving similarly to muscle fibers. We decided\r\n          to go this route instead of the usual pneumatics or hydraulics to\r\n          allow for a large strength boost to the user while keeping the\r\n          apparatus lightweight. The fibers are able to exert <b>2000 J/kg</b>{' '}\r\n          of specific work, which is <b>50x</b> more than natural muscles.\r\n          Electric current is supplied to the fibers which are held in tension\r\n          and connecting the 3 major parts of the design. The electrical current\r\n          is used to heat the fibers - for this project, it was assumed that the\r\n          team at IBM would responsible for handling the control systems that\r\n          supplied the current.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The whole design is broken up into three major components: the hand,\r\n          the forearm, and the bicep. Each component is separated and placed are\r\n          held together using a flexible composite mesh. The mesh also serves to\r\n          be flexible enough that users with various different arm sizes can\r\n          easily equip the CyberLimb and it also acts as an insulator to prevent\r\n          heat from reaching the users’ skin from the fibers being heated. Each\r\n          part is further connected with the nylon cables, for a transfer of\r\n          forces from the bicep to the tip of each finger. The separate parts\r\n          also allow for easy manufacturing of the product and checks of the\r\n          criteria of it being easy to clean. Each part is also broken down\r\n          further into 4 smaller parts that are all connected via an adjustable\r\n          strap. This allows for users with any weight arm to be able to equip\r\n          CyberLimb and adjust the straps to fit their size.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The fingers on the hand are a minor separate part on their own and\r\n          have their movements interconnected (apart from the thumb). This\r\n          allows a user with a disability in some of their fingers to still be\r\n          able to use CyberLimb at its full potential.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          There are no motors or linear actuators used in this design due to the\r\n          special nature of the nylon fibers, which makes the design extremely\r\n          lightweight and compact. A nylon fiber coil is present at both sides\r\n          of the bicep, forearm, and each finger.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Overall the CyberLimb provided a unique solution to the human arm\r\n          exoskeleton concept, using nylon fibers very unique property when\r\n          coiled and heated. One major feasibility concern with this solution\r\n          was the amount of power required to heat each of the fibers to achieve\r\n          the level of strength considered “superhuman”. However, mechanically,\r\n          the solution was complete, efficient, and simple.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Placing 2nd at this Designathon got us an invite to the international\r\n          Designathon where the top teams from each school compete against each\r\n          other, and it will be exciting to see how we fair up.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default CyberMonke;\r\n","import { Button, Link, useColorModeValue } from '@chakra-ui/react';\r\nimport { ArrowBackIcon } from '@chakra-ui/icons';\r\nimport { Link as RouterLink } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nconst Submarine = () => {\r\n  const buttonColor = useColorModeValue('purple', 'green');\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className='blog'>\r\n      <Link as={RouterLink} to='/' style={{ textDecoration: 'none' }}>\r\n        <Button\r\n          leftIcon={<ArrowBackIcon />}\r\n          colorScheme={buttonColor}\r\n          variant='solid'\r\n        >\r\n          Go Back Home\r\n        </Button>\r\n      </Link>\r\n      <div className='blog-title'>\r\n        <h1>Commercial Submarine - Capstone</h1>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className='blog-body'>\r\n        {/* TODO: Add Blog Images */} <h2>Design Criteria</h2> <br />\r\n        <ul>\r\n          <li>Cost-efficient</li>\r\n          <li>Depth rating: 330m to 1000m </li>\r\n          <li>Speed: 2 knots - 6 knots </li>\r\n        </ul>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Introduction</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          The final capstone project is a major milestone for all aspiring\r\n          engineering students. It forces us to use all of the skills learned\r\n          and knowledge gained throughout our degree in one cumulative project.\r\n          The course is worth twice as much as a regular course, and large\r\n          deliverables are submitted every other week. Weekly evaluation\r\n          meetings are held with professors that replicate a professional\r\n          setting, that many engineers find themselves in. Submitting the final\r\n          Capstone report is a right of passage for engineers before they fully\r\n          enter the job market.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Proposed Design</h2>\r\n        <p>\r\n          The event also featured workshops, presentations, and a list of social\r\n          community activities. After two sleepless nights, competitors\r\n          presented their solutions on the third day and the top 3 teams were\r\n          picked for each category. My team, <b>CyberMonkE</b>, placed{' '}\r\n          <b>2nd</b> for the <b>IBM Design Challenge</b>.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Design Criteria</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>Brief Design Summary</h3>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Two translucent acrylic hulls make up the majority of the structure of\r\n          the submarine. Trying to achieve such high speeds of 6 knots, while\r\n          maintaining costs low meant that the design had to be minimal and only\r\n          the most important components were kept, hence the bare-bones look of\r\n          the submarine. A titanium frame wraps around the hulls to seal them\r\n          watertight. Titanium was also the primary material used to manufacture\r\n          the hatch. It was mainly picked due to its corrosion resistance in\r\n          seawater, which greatly outweighed its high cost.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Large thrusters on each side of the submarine control speed and\r\n          movement. Up to 6 batteries are placed at the bottom of the submarine\r\n          (not pictured) in between the main body and the ballasts. Life support\r\n          inside the submarine contains two oxygen tanks, a control system, and\r\n          two CO2 scrubbers. A dehumidifier is also included to control humidity\r\n          and condensation. Four lift points are placed around the frame to\r\n          allow for deployment and rescue. Expoxy penetrators are used to\r\n          allowing for wiring from the outside to the inside of the submarine,\r\n          to allow for use of electrical components.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h3>Parametrization</h3>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Parametrization was important to the design to allow for clients to\r\n          input desired speeds, depths, and dive duration. Each input affected\r\n          the design in a multitude of ways, such as dome thickness, batteries\r\n          required, etc. The parameterization flow chart shows how the inputs\r\n          affected certain aspects of the submarine and the intermediate\r\n          calculations with each changing input.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Finally, the submarine design allowed for a cost-effective, safe, and\r\n          efficient submersible for commercial uses such as tourism, research,\r\n          and recreational. The submarine’s minimal design allows it to meet\r\n          many high-level criteria without largely affecting its weight or cost.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Collaboration with our sister team, which designed the submarine’s\r\n          ballasts, is one thing that can be improved in the future, to allow\r\n          for better connectivity between the main body and the ballasts.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br />\r\n        <p>\r\n          Working on this Commercial Submarine Capstone Project was a valuable\r\n          experience for my team and I.
